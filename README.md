# FitSqueezedThermal
Mathematica notebooks for Squeezed Thermal States Analysis presented in arXiv:2111.04923
The notebooks include all the datasets used saved in cells. That is the reason there is a .zip file. That's the reason why one of the notebooks needed to be compressed to fit github file size. 
However you can use the code to generate your own datasets and fit the simulated data for the set of parameters desired. 
All the functions needed are defined in the notebooks, in Section 1 and some in other sections.
